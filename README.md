# Rscoop - A Modern, Powerful GUI for Scoop

![Rscoop Showcase Banner](pics/logo.png)

Welcome to **Rscoop**, a beautiful and feature-rich graphical user interface for the [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) package manager on Windows. Rscoop is designed to be a complete replacement for the command line, providing a fast, intuitive, and powerful way to manage your software.

Built with a focus on performance and a clean user experience, Rscoop leverages the speed of Rust and the modern reactivity of SolidJS to make managing your Scoop packages a joy.

## ‚ú® Features

Rscoop is more than just a package list. It's a full-fledged management toolkit.

### üì¶ Core Package Management
- **Blazing Fast Search**: Instantly search for packages across all your buckets, powered by `sfsu`.
- **Install & Uninstall**: Easily install new packages and remove old ones with a click.
- **One-Click Updates**: See all available updates and upgrade all your packages at once.
- **Detailed Package Info**: Click on any package to open a modal with detailed information, notes, and metadata.
- **View Manifests**: Inspect the JSON manifest for any package directly within the app.

### üõ°Ô∏è System Health & Security
- **VirusTotal Integration**: Automatically scan packages on install to protect you from malware. Rscoop will warn you if any detections are found.
- **System Doctor**: A central hub for maintaining your Scoop installation.
    - **Health Checkup**: Run diagnostics to find and fix common problems with your Scoop setup.
    - **Smart Cleanup**: Free up disk space by cleaning up old, uninstalled package versions and outdated cache files.
- **Hold Packages**: Prevent specific packages from being updated, giving you full control over your versions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Control
- **Cache Manager**: Get a detailed view of all cached installer files, see how much space they're using, and selectively remove them.
- **Shim Manager**: A complete interface to manage your Scoop shims. View, remove, add, and even `alter` shims without touching the command line.
- **Customizable Views**: Switch between a responsive grid view and a detailed list view for your installed packages. Sort and filter with ease.
