## ‚ú® Features ‚Äì Scoop GUI for Windows

Rscoop is more than just a package list. It's a full-fledged, native management toolkit that supercharges your Scoop experience.

### üöÄ Blazing-Fast Native Performance
At its core, Rscoop leverages a custom-built Rust backend to handle the heavy lifting. We've re-engineered critical logic to be native to Rscoop, delivering incredible speed and responsiveness.
- **Instant Search**: Find the exact package you need in milliseconds. Our native search implementation scans all your buckets instantly.
- **Package & Update Discovery**: Listing installed packages and checking for available updates is faster than ever.

### ü™£ Bucket Management in Scoop GUI
Rscoop introduces a full-featured bucket management system, allowing you to discover, add, and manage Scoop buckets without ever leaving the app.
- **Browse & Search**: Explore thousands of community buckets, not just the default ones.
- **Install & Remove**: Add or remove buckets with a single click.
- **View Manifests**: Instantly view package manifests within any bucket.
- **Offline Search**: A smart caching system downloads bucket data for lightning-fast offline searching.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Scoop Package Management
Rscoop provides a level of control that goes far beyond the standard command line. Manage every aspect of your Scoop installation and packages through an intuitive UI.
- **Shim Manager**: A complete interface to manage your Scoop shims. View, remove, and even `alter` shims without touching the command line.
- **Hold Packages**: Prevent specific packages from being updated with a single click, giving you full control over your versions.
- **Cache Manager**: Get a detailed view of all cached installer files, see how much space they're using, and selectively remove them.
- **Package Details**: Instantly view detailed information, notes, and the full package manifest for any application.
- **Version Management**: Seamlessly switch between versions on versioned installs of packages.

### üõ°Ô∏è System Health
Keep your Scoop installation in top shape with our integrated System Doctor.
- **Dependency Checkup**: Run diagnostics to find and fix common problems with your Scoop setup, like missing Git/7-Zip, with a single button click.
- **Cache cleaner**: Clean-up junk with one click (doesn't clean versioned installs)

### ‚úÖ Seamless & Secure Operations
For core actions, Rscoop acts as a seamless wrapper around the battle-tested official Scoop CLI, ensuring maximum compatibility and reliability. All operations are fully integrated into the UI‚Äîyou'll never see a command prompt.
- **Install, Uninstall, & Update**: Manage packages with the click of a button, backed by Scoop's robust engine.
- **Security-First Installation**: A standout Rscoop feature. Before installing, the application can automatically scan the package with VirusTotal. This pre-install check protects you from malware by blocking the installation if threats are detected, a safety layer not present in standard Scoop.
- **System Cleanup**: Easily clean up old package versions to free up disk space.
