### Release Notes

#### Added
- **Settings Page Redesign**: Settings are now organized into clear tabs (Automation, Management, Security, Window & UI, About) for faster navigation.
- **Automatic Bucket & Package Updates**: Background scheduler with wall-clock persistence auto-updates buckets and optionally packages after bucket refresh. Supports custom intervals and short debug intervals.
- **Start on Boot**: New Startup toggle lets Rscoop launch automatically with Windows; integrates version-aware MSI mismatch handling.

#### Improved
- **Version-Aware Launch Behavior**: Updated builds trigger a mismatch notice even on auto-start to ensure a clean post-update relaunch.


#### Documentation
