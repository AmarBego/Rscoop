# User Guide

This guide walks through each of the major areas of Rscoop. Use the navigation on the left to jump into detailed instructions for search, installed packages, bucket management, system doctor, and settings.

Every page surfaces real-time status from Scoop and is backed by native Rust commands exposed through Tauri. Operations show progress feedback and inject clear error messaging if something goes wrong.

If you are in a hurry, start with the **[Search](search.md)** page to find packages, then move on to **[Installed](installed.md)** to manage what is on your machine.
